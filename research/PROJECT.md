# Project

Here you can find my notes, thoughts, and also ideas on our project.

Our initial ideas:

1. Assembly simulator
   1. Examples: 
      1. [Simple 8-Bit Assembler Simulator](https://schweigi.github.io/assembler-simulator/)
      2. [Assembler Simulator](https://tinyurl.com/asmsim)
      3. ARM Keil (in debug mode)
   2. Visualize following data (after execution of each line):
      1. Registers and their values
      2. CPU Flags and their values
      3. Opcode of instruction
      4. Content of memory
   3. Both w/o GUI possible (for more info on xUI [both GUI and TUI] jump to the bottom of this page)
   4. Simple or minimal architectures and ISAs available:
      1. CHIP-8
      2. 6502
      3. Microprocoessor sms32v50
      4. MIPS 32
      5. Cutom or self-made architecture

**Important:** We do not have to implement the whole instruction set. A subset will be enough.

1. Password Manager
   1. Enough examples out there
   2. Password generation (secure random and not pseudo-random)
   3. Password storing (e. g. using zero-knowledge proof as Bitwarden does)

**Important:** After a disucussion with other members, we decided to work on the assembly simulaor. Therefore, no further discussion or research on this matter is needed.
