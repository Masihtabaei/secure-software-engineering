# Masihâ€™s Learning Log: Exploring The Rust Programming Language Book

## Introduction

Here you will find my notes and thoughts on the well-known book [*The Rust Programming Language*](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/). After a while I switched to the more interactive version of the book (available [here](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/experiment-intro.html)).

## 4 Understanding Ownership

### Lecture Correspondence

This chapter corresponds partially to lecture slides form the first two weeks with following file names:

- 01_SecSE25_Slides_20250321.pdf
- 02_SecSE25_Slides_20250328.pdf

### Notes and Thoughts

Goals of Rust:
- Preventing undefined behaviors
- Compile-time preventioln for the sake of performance and productivity

Safety:
- Absence of undefined bahvior (e. g. using an undefined variable)

Undefined bahvior:
- [Comprehensive list](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/behavior-considered-undefined.html)
- Successfull execution without crashing
- Immediate crash due to some faults (e. g. segmentation fault) or other operating system errors
- Later crash after an actor misused the gap
- Dangerous esp. for low-level programs (memory corruptions cause of around 70% of reported security vulnerabilities)
- 

Checking for undefined bahviors during compilation time and runtime:
- Compile error during compilation time (e. g. in Rust)
- Exception during runtime (e. g. in Python or Javascript)
- Compile-time checks more efficient (less runtime checks and also avoiding bugs in production)

Ownership:
- Most unique feature of Rust
- Discipline of pointer management (not restricted to only heap pointers)
- Enabler for memory safety gurantees without garbage collector

Stack and Heap in Rust:
- *Arrays* on the stack and *Boxes* on the heap
- Actual copy for stack-based values
- Pointer or address copy for heap-based values (esp. more efficient for *Boxes*) 

Memory and its management:
- Pointers -> pointees
- Manual memory management in Rust forbidden (no direct access to *malloc* or *free*)!
- Owner reponsible for automatic memory management

Boxes:
- One way of allocating memory on the heap
- Self or similar structures used by other data structures like *Vec*, *String*, and *HashMap*

Move:
- Shallow copy
- Source not available after

Clone:
- Deep copy
- Both source and target available after move

Summary:
- Only one owner for heap data permitted
- Automatic heap deallocation after going out of scope
- Ownership transfer possible via move (used by assignments and function calls)
